# Sending Email with Rails

## Creating a Contact Form

(when a visitor wants to send an email to you, the app owner)

### Demo

    rails g scaffold Greeting email:text content:text

#####config/routes.rb

    root to: 'greeting#index'

#####config/environment.rb

    ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {
      :user_name => 'your_email@gmail.com',
      :password => 'your_password',
      :domain => 'whatever_or_your_actual_domain',
      :address => 'smtp.gmail.com',
      :port => 587,
      :authentication => :plain,
      :enable_starttls_auto => true
    }

Note: best practice here is to store the email and password into environmental variables in a .env file that you create in the Rails root directory - the above is just the quick and dirty way

    touch app/mailers/notifier.rb
    touch app/views/notifier/greeting_notification.text.erb

(shortcut: rails g mailer Notifier)

##### app/mailers/notifier.rb

    class Notifier < ActionMailer::Base
      def greeting_notification(form_input)
        mail(to: "someone@gmail.com", from: form_input.email, subject: "New message from #{form_input.email}")
      end
    end

##### app/views/notifier/greeting_notification.text.erb

    Message from <%= @greeting.email %>
    <%= @greeting.content %>

##### app/models/greeting.rb

    after_commit :send_notification
    def send_notification
      Notifier.greeting_notification(self).deliver
    end


### Lab

Make your own contact form, similar to the one above. It should have all of the fields below, and they should all be used in the email that is sent.

* Visitor Name
* Visitor Email
* Subject
* Content

#### Bonus 1 

Research [SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com/). What is it, and why should we use it instead of Gmail?

#### Bonus 2 

Research [Pony](https://github.com/benprew/pony). What is this Gem and why might we want to use it? What are the downsides to using it?
